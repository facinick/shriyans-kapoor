abstract: "This article delves into two methods for iterating in TypeScript, focusing on collections or aggregates of items. The first method involves separate classes for items and iterators, encapsulating the iteration process. The second method, a more concise approach, combines item and collection logic into one class, making it a straightforward and engaging experience. Gain insights into TypeScript's iteration capabilities and choose the method that suits your needs."
