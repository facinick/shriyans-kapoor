title: "[quick notes] Iterate in Typescript"
abstract: "This article delves into two methods for iterating in TypeScript, focusing on collections or aggregates of items. The first method involves separate classes for items and iterators, encapsulating the iteration process. The second method, a more concise approach, combines item and collection logic into one class, making it a straightforward and engaging experience. Gain insights into TypeScript's iteration capabilities and choose the method that suits your needs."

## Terminology

`Aggregate` or `Collection` is the Class you want to iterate using for…of for…in etc.

`Item` is the object, many of which are is inside the `Collection`/`Aggregate`

_example: A Collection is `Students`, where you want to iterate over every individual Item which is a `Student`_

`Iterable` is a built-in interface in Typescript

You want to do something like:

```tsx
for (const student of students) {
  console.log(student);
}
```

## Method one (Iterator and Iterable separate classes)

Item Class:

```tsx
class Item {}
```

Collection Iterator Class:

```tsx
// This class' sole purpose is to encapsulate iteration for the Aggregate/Collection
class CollectionIterator implements Iterator<Item> {
  // The collection of items over which you want to iterate
  collection: Array<Item> = [];

  constructor(collection: Array<Item>) {
    this.collection = collection;
  }

  next(value?: any): IteratorResult<Item> {
    // Return the next value and done (is iteration completed or not)
    return {
      done: false,
      value: new Item(),
    };
  }
}
```

Collection (or an Aggregate) Class:

```tsx
// A class that holds collection to a bunch of similar items, and other related things
class Collection implements Iterable<Item> {
		collection: Array<Item> = []

		// Override this method to implement Iterable interface
		// Return the AggregateIterator class object
    [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<Item> {
        return new CollectionIterator(this.collection)
    }
}
```

## Method two (All in one, al ways fun)

Item Class:

```tsx
class Item {}
```

Collection (or an Aggregate) Class:

```tsx
class Collection { // No need to explicitly implement any build-in interface

    collection: Array<Item> = []

		// No need to explicitly have IterableIterator<Item> as return type
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
        return this;
    }

		// No need to explicitly have IteratorResult<Item> as return type
    next() {
        return {
					done: false,
					value: new Item()
				}
    }
}
```
